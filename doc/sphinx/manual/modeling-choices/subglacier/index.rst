The subglacier
==============

This section describes how to control PISM's sub-models of subglacial processes: the basal
strength, the subglacial hydrology, and bed deformation.

Two of these sections (:ref:`sec-basestrength` and :ref:`sec-bedsmooth`) can be thought of
as parts of PISM's stress balance model: they cover PISM's treatment of basal boundary
conditions: the former for stress balance models including longitudinal stresses, and the
latter for the non-sliding SIA flow.
