See :numref:`tab-funding` for the full list of grants that supported PISM development.

The Snow, Ice, and Permafrost group at the Geophysical Institute is the home for the
University of Alaska PISM developers; find us in Elvey 410D. The Arctic Region
Supercomputing Center (now RCS) has provided significant computational resources and
technical help in the development of PISM.

Thanks for comments/questions from many PISM users around the world, including these not
already listed as PISM authors:

for helpful comments and questions on PISM and this *Manual*. Dave Covey, Don Bahls, and
Greg Newby have supported our hardware, software, and computations. Bob Bindschadler,
Sophie Nowicki, Jesse Johnson, and others in the SeaRISE group have motivated and assisted
PISM development in many ways.
