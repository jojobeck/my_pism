Installing PISM
+++++++++++++++

The fastest path to a fully functional PISM installation is to use a Linux system with a
Debian-based package system (e.g. Ubuntu_): Start by following subsection
:ref:`sec-install-debian`, then :ref:`sec-install-petsc`, then :ref:`sec-install-pism` to
install PISM itself.
