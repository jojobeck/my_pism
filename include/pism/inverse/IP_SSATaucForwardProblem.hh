//! Implements the forward problem of the map taking \f$\tau_c\f$ to the corresponding solution of the %SSA.
/*! The class SSAFEM solves the %SSA, and the solution depends on a large number of parameters.  Considering
  all of these to be fixed except for \f$\tau_c\f$, we obtain a map \f$F_{\rm SSA}\f$ taking
  \f$\tau_c\f$ to the corresponding solution \f$u_{\rm SSA}\f$ of the %SSA.  This is a forward problem which
  we would like to invert; given \f$u_{\rm SSA}\f$ determine \f$\tau_c\f$  such that
  \f$F_{\rm SSA}(\tau_c) = u_{\rm SSA}\f$.  The forward problem actually implemented by
  IP_SSATaucForwardProblem is a mild variation \f$F_{\rm SSA}\f$.

  First, given the constraint \f$\tau_c\ge 0\f$ it can be helpful to parameterize \f$\tau_c\f$ by some other
  parameter \f$\zeta\f$,
  \f[
  \tau_c = g(\zeta),
  \f]
  where the function \f$g\f$ is non-negative.  The function \f$g\f$ is specified by an instance
  of IPDesignVariableParameterization.

  Second, there may be locations where the value of \f$\tau_c\f$ (and hence \f$\zeta\f$)
  is known a-priori, and should not be adjusted.  Let \f$\pi\f$ be the map that replaces
  the values of \f$\zeta\f$ with known values at these locations.

  IP_SSATaucForwardProblem implements the forward problem
  \f[
  F(\zeta) = F_{\rm SSA}(g(\pi(\zeta))).
  \f]

  Algorithms to solve the inverse problem make use of variations on the linearization
  of \f$F\f$, which are explained below.

  The solution of the %SSA in SSAFEM is implemented using SNES to solve
  a nonlinear residual function of the form
  \f[
  \mathcal{R}_{SSA}(u;\tau_c, \text{other parameters})= \vec 0,
  \f]
  usually using Newton's method. Let
  \f[
  \mathcal{R}(u, \zeta) = \mathcal{R}_{SSA}(u; g(\pi(\zeta)), \text{other parameters}).
  \f]

  The derivative of \f$\mathcal{R}\f$ with respect to \f$ u\f$ is called the state Jacobian,
  \f$J_{\rm State}\f$. Specifically, if \f$u=[U_j]\f$ then
  \f[
  (J_{\rm State})_{ij} = \frac{d \mathcal{R}_i}{dU_j}.
  \f]
  This is exactly the same Jacobian that is computed by SSAFEM for solving the %SSA via SNES. The
  matrix for the design Jacobian can be obtained with \ref assemble_jacobian_state.

  The derivative of \f$\mathcal{R}\f$ with respect to \f$ \zeta\f$ is called the design Jacobian,
  \f$J_{\rm Design}\f$. Specifically, if \f$\zeta=[Z_k]\f$ then
  \f[
  (J_{\rm Design})_{ik} = \frac{d \mathcal{R}_i}{dZ_k}.
  \f]
  The map \f$J_{\rm Design}\f$ can be applied to a vector \f$d\zeta\f$ with
  apply_jacobian_design.  For inverse methods using adjoints, one also
  needs to be able to apply the transpose of \f$J_{\rm Design}\f$,
  which is done using \ref apply_jacobian_design_transpose.

  The forward problem map \f$F\f$ solves the implicit equation
  \f[
  \mathcal{R}(F(\zeta), \zeta) = 0.
  \f]
  Its linearisation \f$DF\f$ then satisfies
  \f[
  J_{\rm State}\; DF\; d\zeta + J_{\rm Design}\; d\zeta = 0
  \f]
  for any perturbation \f$d\zeta\f$.  Hence
  \f[
  DF = -J_{\rm State}^{-1}\circ J_{\rm Design}.
  \f]
  This derivative is sometimes called the reduced gradient in the literature.  To
  apply \f$DF\f$ to a perturbation \f$d\zeta\f$, use \ref apply_linearization.  Adjoint
  methods require the transpose of this map; to apply \f$DF^t\f$ to \f$du\f$ use
  \ref apply_linearization_transpose.

    generated by, e.g., \f$J_{\rm Design}^t\f$ are represented as vectors in the full
