To use these examples you must build the PISM python bindings.  You will need to
have both SWIG and petsc4py installed.

To build the bindings, you will need to first set the cmake flag
Pism_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS:
  $ cd 'your PISM root directory'
  $ cd build
  $ ccmake ..   # then set Pism_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS
  $ make install
Now identify where the PISM python libraries were put something like
  'some install prefix'/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PISM/...
In that case you will need to add this location to your PYTHONPATH, e.g.
  $ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages

See 'your PISM root directory'/src/pythonbindings/README.txt for additional info
on installation.

If the above install is correct then coming back to this directory and trying an
example should work:
  $ cd examples/python/ssa_tests/
  $ ./ssa_testj.py

Of course you can run these inside python:
  $ python      # or ipython or 'ipython -pylab'
  $ run pross -i ross.nc -bootstrap -Mx 147 -My 147 -riggs riggs.nc  # FIXME:  not sure these options are handled correctly ... try changing them ... or do you have a different usage mode?
