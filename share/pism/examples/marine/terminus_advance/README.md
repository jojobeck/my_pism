### Marine-terminating glacier advance test

Uses a simplified flowline setup and a constant velocity field to test PISM's mass transport code.

The particular case we are testing: a marine-terminating glacier should be able to advance past the grounding line even if all floating ice is immediately calved off, provided that the ice at the terminus is thick enough.
