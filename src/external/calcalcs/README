These are the Calender Calculation (CalCalcs routines), version 1.0,
released Jan 7, 2010.

The CalCalcs routines are written in C and provide:

1. A replacement for the udunits library "utCalendar" and "utInvCalendar"
routines, which are extended to include various calendars, and work
for version 2 of the udunits library.  These routines allow 
converting an arbitrary time span in arbitrary temporal units into a date.
For example, they can be used to compute the date that is "1800 seconds 
since 1901-01-01 12:00", or "-366 days since 1750-09-27 00:00", or
"14876.259 hours since 2200-12-31", etc.  Gregorian, Julian, our Standard 
civil, noleap, and 360_day calendars are supported.

2. A set of routines that implement calendar calculations for supported
calendars.  For example, computing the day-of-year, Julian Day number,
date, date-since, etc.

For details on how to use the library, see its homepage at:

The routines are intended to be incorporated into programs that
need calendar-calculation functionality.  As such, there are only two 
short stand-alone example programs provided.
